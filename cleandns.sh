#	Clear DNS Caches 1.0.2
#	
#	Does what it says on the tin: Cleans your DNS cache.

#	Author: Lee Hodson
#	URL: https://github.com/VR51/Clean-DNS
#	URL: https://journalxtra.com/linux/bash-linuxsanity/script-clean-linux-dns-cache/
#
#	How to Use
#
#	Download this file (cleandns.sh).
#	Make the script executable.
#	Click the script to run it.
#	Or run it from the commandline with ./cleandns.sh (you will need to be in the same directory as the script)
# 
#	Script written because I got annoyed at keying in various commands to clean my DNS cache
#	whenever I changed a website's IP address.
#
#	Try Host Flash if you want a better way to manage host files and clear your DNS cache

	# This code section is released in public domain by Han Boetes <han@mijncomputer.nl>
	# Updated by Dave Davenport <qball@gmpclient.org>
	# Updated by Lee Hodson <https://journalxtra.com> - Added break on successful hit, added more terminals, humanized the failure message, replaced call to rofi with printf and made $terminal an array for easy reuse.
	#
	# This script tries to exec a terminal emulator by trying some known terminal
	# emulators.
	#
	# We welcome patches that add distribution-specific mechanisms to find the
	# preferred terminal emulator. On Debian, there is the x-terminal-emulator
	# symlink for example.
